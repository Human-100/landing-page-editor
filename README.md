This editor is 100% self-contained, everything is in one single HTML file, with no external dependencies, no CDNs, and no third-party libraries.

✅ No external scripts
✅ No network requests
✅ No tracking
✅ No runtime dependencies

Because of this, it's:

    Safe to use offline

    Secure for use inside internal tools

    Easy to embed or integrate into any system, whether it's a local app, CMS, admin panel, or SaaS product.

    ✅ No frameworks, no external libraries, and no external security concerns. Just pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🖱️ How It Works

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Toolbar**|Controls for Load, Save, Preview, Export, Close|
|**Sidebar**|Edit text, images, styles, attributes, and structure|
|**Editor Frame**|Shows your live editable HTML page inside an iframe|

All logic is handled in-browser using JavaScript and the DOM API.
